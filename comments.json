Are you saying that bugs and glitches don't exist unless I hack my game and put them there myself? Cause that is an extremely dumb statement. \n\nI experiences several bugs and glitches. The softlocke in Snowpoint gym. The graphical glitch of surfing after a battle. Having a shiny Pokemon grass patch spawn underneath an npc, making it impossible to encounter. The calculator on the Poketch is just completely broken.\n\nAnd those were just he ones I experienced. And no...I didn't;t hack my game. Bugs like those exists becuase of the programmers. There's way more bugs and glitches than that. Having to constantly update your game becuase it's filled with bugs is ridiculous.\n\nJust becuase you didn't;t experience any bugs, doesn't;t they they don't exists. Lots of people have experienced bugs and glitches in the game. That's why people are complaining.\n\nThese rakes offer barely anything new from the originals. In fact, there's a lot of content missing. Unlike HG/SS and ORAS that actually improved the game, added new mechanics, story, characters, etc. BDSP is a copy paste game. \n\nAnd no....having a game filled with bugs isn't \"something simple\". Some of these are literally a game-breaking. And you're now claiming that me pointing out bugs and glitches mean I suddenly never cared? What he fuck are you making baseless claims like that? Like..why are you making up bs like that? Are you just trying to get me angry to argue with you? Flat out accusing someone of that is just pathetic.\n\nI literally said that I had fun with the game. I enjoyed it. But it didn't improve form the originals. It was filled with questionable decisions and bugs. For people who were waiting a long time for gen 4 remakes, and then not getting a true remake....it's a let down. Lots of people wanted an improved game. Not just graphics and nostalgia.
