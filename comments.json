He was winning free kicks and getting Chelsea players booked coz they couldn't handle him.

No wonder United are failing as a football club. Get rid of the lot of them and start again. In all honesty, it's early days for Rangnick (also not confirmed) but if he turns out what people say i wouldn't mind if after six months he concentrates on the structure of the club and obviously get rid of useless Fletcher (Technical Director, the one that puts the cones out, it seems we now live in a world where we give simple jobs fancy names) and the other coaching staff especially MvKenna and get Red Bull to buy the Glazers out and start running it as a top football club and not an all mates together club and also don't prioritise making money from the brand name, always football first, the club wouldn't be what they are if it wasn't for the fans.", "time": "12 hours ago", "author": "Ns", "channel": "UCFY3yGgPVbs61HDakKBqhRw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRU91POkBuPj0laC2HnnZ8VuZUZ_eTrWeptUvr9uA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
